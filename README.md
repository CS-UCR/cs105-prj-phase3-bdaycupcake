# CS105 Project Phase 3
## Data Analysis

## Project Descriptions
In this project, we compare and explore the relationship among cost of living for each country and major city worldwide. The cost of living is the amount of money needed to sustain a certain standard of 
living by affording basic expenses. Basic expenses include hosing, food, taxes, and healthcare. Cities or metropolitan areas that have higher costs of living should also have higher salary wages than areas with a lower cost of 
living. In this project, we have obtained 3 datasets containing cost of living data for countries and major cities worldwide. A cost of living index measures the differences in the price of goods and services over periods of time 
or between cities, regions, and countries. To list a few that we will be using throughout the project:
- The Rent index is an estimation of prices of renting apartments in a location compared to another. 
- The Restuarnts index is a comparison of prices of meals and drinks in restaurants and bars in a location compared to another. 
- Local purchasing power shows the relative purchasing power in buying goods and services in a given location for the average wage in that location.\
The data presented here is indexed based on 100 for each field. In other words, a country or a city with an index below 100 are less expensive and indexes above 100 are more expensive than the pivot location.

## Phase 1
**Sungho Ahn**: Responsible for whole Phase 1\
***Contribution***: Creating crawler and obtain relevant datasets.\
Created web-crawler using Scrapy and using the web-crawler, twitter API, and online downloading from Kaggle, I have obtained the following three datasets we've used throughout the project phases:
- cost-of-living-1.csv
- cost-of-living-2.csv
- cost-of-living-3.csv\
The file names have changed for convenience in coding process.

## Phase 2
**Sungho Ahn**: Responsible for whole Phase 2\
***Contribution***: Data cleaning and performing EDA.\
Cleaned irrelevant columns/fields from each dataset and combined the datasets to have a master dataset to use widely. Also performed EDA using various methods of visualization such as:
- Histogram
- Scatter Plot
- Parallel Coordinates
