## Data Analysis

## Project Descriptions
The cost of living is the amount of money needed to sustain a certain standard of living by affording basic expenses. Basic expenses include hosing, food, taxes, and healthcare. Cities or metropolitan areas that have higher costs 
of living should also have higher salary wages than areas with a lower cost of living. In this project, we have obtained 3 datasets containing cost of living data for countries and major cities worldwide. A cost of living index 
measures the differences in the price of goods and services over periods of time or between cities, regions, and countries. To list a few that we will be using throughout the project:  The Rent index is an estimation of prices of 
renting apartments in a location compared to another. The Restuarnts index is a comparison of prices of meals and drinks in restaurants and bars in a location compared to another. Local purchasing power shows the relative 
purchasing power in buying goods and services in a given location for the average wage in that location.  The data presented here is indexed based on 100 for each field. In other words, a country or a city with an index below 100 
are less expensive and indexes above 100 are more expensive than the pivot location.
